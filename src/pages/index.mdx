SGLang

## Hobbies

I love swimming and I'm pretty good at it. Think you can beat me? Throw down the gauntlet!

## Family and Friends

I'm from Shanxi, Chinaâ€”home of the world's best vinegar and knife-cut noodles! ðŸ˜Ž

Meet my cat, Gousheng(ç‹—å‰©). Despite his tough-looking face, he's actually the sweetest little companion â€” he loves curling up next to people at night and is always ready for a good nap together. Fun fact: Gousheng comes all the way from the East Campus of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
