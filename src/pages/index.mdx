## Projects

- [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang): A fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models.  
- TODO.

## Hobbies

- Swimming: My favorite sport. Think you can beat me? Throw down the gauntlet!
- LEGO: I'm a huge LEGO fan, and I make stop-motion animations with it.
- Oil pastels: I enjoy drawing with oil pastels ‚Äî though half the fun is ending up with more color on my hands than on the paper!

Meet my cat, Gousheng(ÁãóÂâ©). Despite his tough-looking face, he is actually the sweetest little companion ‚Äî he loves curling up next to people at night and is always ready for a good nap together. Fun fact: Gousheng comes all the way from the East Campus of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
